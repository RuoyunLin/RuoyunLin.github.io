- name: Predicting users booking intent
  descr: At trivago, my first project is to predict users booking intent. We asked users to report their booking intent when they landed on our webpage. More than 10200 users responded. The behavioral data of those users were extracted and merged with the attitudinal data for further analysis. Methods like logistic regression were used to find out the most important predictors of user intent. Various machine learning techniques (e.g., GradientBoosting) were also used to predict user intent.

  descr: During my PhD, I worked for a ERC(European Research Council)-funded project called <a href="http://www.redeftie.eu/?page_id=2">"Redefining Tie Strength"</a>. It explores how social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, can help us gain informational and emotional benefits. I mainly do research on the psychological effects of social media usage. Besides this, I am also interested in how social media usage can influence consumer behavior.
