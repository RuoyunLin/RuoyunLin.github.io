- name: Redefining tie strength
  descr: During my PhD, I was working for a European Research Council (ERC)-funded project called ReDefTie - redefining tie strength. It explores how social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, can help us gain informational and emotional benefits. I mainly do research on the psychological effects of social media usage. Besides this, I am also interested in how social media usage can influence consumer behavior.
